Create a function that takes a string as an argument 
and returns a coded (h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.

=> Examples

  hacker_speak("javascript is cool") ➞ "j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l"

  hacker_speak("programming is fun") ➞ "pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun"

  hacker_speak("become a coder") ➞ "b3c0m3 4 c0d3r"


Notes:
In order to work properly, the function should replace all "a"s with 4, "e"s with 3, "i"s with 1, "o"s with 0, and "s"s with 5.
