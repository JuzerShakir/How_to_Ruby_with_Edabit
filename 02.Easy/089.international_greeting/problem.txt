International Greetings
Suppose you have a guest list of students and the country they are from, stored as key-value pairs in a hash.

GUEST_LIST = {
"Randy" => "Germany",
"Karla" => "France",
"Wendy" => "Japan",
"Norman" => "England",
"Sam" => "Argentina"
}
Write a function that takes in a name and returns a name tag, that should read:

"Hi! I'm [name], and I'm from [country]."
If the name is not in the hash, return:

"Hi! I'm a guest."
Examples
greeting("Randy") ➞ "Hi! I'm Randy, and I'm from Germany."

greeting("Sam") ➞ "Hi! I'm Sam, and I'm from Argentina."

greeting("Monti") ➞ "Hi! I'm a guest."
