Wild Roger is participating in a Western Showdown, meaning he has to draw
(pull out and shoot) his gun faster than his opponent in a gun standoff.

Given two strings,p1 and p2, return which person drew their gun the fastest.
If both are drawn at the same time, return "tie".

    p1"   Bang!        "
    p2"        Bang!   "
        p1

    p1"       Bang!  "
    p2"        Bang!   "
        p2

    p1"   Bang!        "
    p2"   Bang!      "
        tie
