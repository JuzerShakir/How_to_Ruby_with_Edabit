I'm trying to watch some lectures to study for my next exam but I keep getting distracted by meme compilations, vine compilations, anime, and more on my favorite video platform.

Your job is to help me create a function that takes a string and checks to see if it contains the following words or phrases:

"anime"
"meme"
"vines"
"roasts"
"Danny DeVito"
If it does, return "NO!". Otherwise, return "Safe watching!".

Examples
prevent_distractions("vines that butter my eggroll") ➞ "NO!"

prevent_distractions("Hot pictures of Danny DeVito") ➞ "NO!"

prevent_distractions("How to ace BC Calculus in 5 Easy Steps") ➞ "Safe watching!"
