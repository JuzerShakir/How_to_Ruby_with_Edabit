Given an array of numbers and a value n, write a function that returns the
probability of choosing a number greater than or equal to n from the array.
The probability should be expressed as a percentage, rounded to one decimal place.

probability([5, 1, 8, 9], 6) ➞ 50.0

probability([7, 4, 17, 14, 12, 3], 16) ➞ 16.7

Precent probability of event =
    100 * (num of favourable outcomes) / (total num of possible outcomes)
