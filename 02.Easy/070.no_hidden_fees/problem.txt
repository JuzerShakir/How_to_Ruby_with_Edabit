No Hidden Fees
Given an array of prices prices and a "supposed" total t, return true if there is a hidden fee added to the total (i.e. the total is greater than the sum of prices), otherwise return false.

Examples
has_hidden_fee(["$2", "$4", "$1", "$8"], "$15") ➞ false

has_hidden_fee(["$1", "$2", "$3"], "$6") ➞ false

has_hidden_fee(["$1"], "$4") ➞ true
Notes
Remember that each price is given as a string.
All $ signs will be at the beginning of the number.
