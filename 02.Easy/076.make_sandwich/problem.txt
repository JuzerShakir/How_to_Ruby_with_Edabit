Making a Sandwich
Given an array of ingredients i and a flavour f as input, create a function that returns the array, but with the elements bread around the selected ingredient.

Examples
make_sandwich(["tuna", "ham", "tomato"], "ham") ➞ ["tuna", "bread", "ham", "bread", "tomato"]

make_sandwich(["cheese", "lettuce"], "cheese") ➞ ["bread", "cheese", "bread", "lettuce"]

make_sandwich(["ham", "ham"], "ham") ➞ ["bread", "ham", "bread", "bread", "ham", "bread"]
Notes
You will always get valid inputs.
Make two separate sandwiches if two of the same elements are next to each other (see example #3).
