Write a function that receives two portions of a path and joins them. The portions will be joined with the "/" separator. There could be only one separator and if it is not present it should be added.

Examples
join_path("portion1", "portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"

join_path("portion1/", "portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"

join_path("portion1", "/portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"

join_path("portion1/", "/portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"
Notes
Try not to solve this challenge using only if-else conditions.
