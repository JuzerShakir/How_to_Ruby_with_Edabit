Scrabble Hand
Given an array of scrabble tiles, create a function that outputs the maximum possible score a player can achieve by summing up the total number of points for all the tiles in their hand. Each hand contains 7 scrabble tiles.

Here's an example hand:

[
  { "tile" => "N", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "K", "score" => 5 },
  { "tile" => "Z", "score" => 10 },
  { "tile" => "X", "score" => 8 },
  { "tile" => "D", "score" => 2 },
  { "tile" => "A", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "E", "score" => 1 }
]
The players maximum score from playing all these tiles would be 1 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1, or 28.

Examples
maximum_score([
  { "tile" => "N", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "K", "score" => 5 },
  { "tile" => "Z", "score" => 10 },
  { "tile" => "X", "score" => 8 },
  { "tile" => "D", "score" => 2 },
  { "tile" => "A", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "E", "score" => 1 }
]) ➞ 28

maximum_score([
  { "tile" => "B", "score" => 2 },
  { "tile" => "V", "score" => 4 },
  { "tile" => "F", "score" => 4 },
  { "tile" => "U", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "D", "score" => 2 },
  { "tile" => "O", "score" => 1 },
  { "tile" => "U", "score" => 1 }
]) ➞ 15
Notes
Here, each tile is represented as a hash with two keys: tile and score.
