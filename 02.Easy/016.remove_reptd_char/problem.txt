Create a function that will remove any repeated charcter(s) in a word passed to
the function. Not just consecutive characters, but characters repeating anywhere in
the input.

  unrepeated("hello") ➞ "helo"

  nrepeated("aaaaa") ➞ "a"

  unrepeated("WWE!!!") ➞ "WE!"

  unrepeated("call 911") ➞ "cal 91"
