Create a function that ends the first word of a phrase with "ed", essentially verbifying a noun.

Examples
verbify("cheese burger") ➞ "cheesed burger"

verbify("salt water") ➞ "salted water"

verbify("orange juice") ➞ "oranged juice"

verbify("shredded cheese") ➞ "shredded cheese"
Notes
Change only the first word.
Note that some words may already end in "e" or "ed".
All phrases will be in lowercase.
