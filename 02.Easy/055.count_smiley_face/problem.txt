Create a function that takes an array of strings and return the number of smiley faces contained within it. These are the components that make up a valid smiley:

A smiley has eyes. Eyes can be : or ;.
A smiley has a nose but it doesn't have to. A nose can be - or ~.
A smiley has a mouth which can be ) or D.
No other characters are allowed except for those mentioned above.

Examples
count_smileys([":)", ";(", ";}", ":-D"]) ➞ 2

count_smileys([";D", ":-(", ":-)", ";~)"]) ➞ 3

count_smileys([";]", ":[", ";*", ":$", ";-D"]) ➞ 1
Notes
You will always be given an array as input.
An empty list should return 0.
The order of each facial element will always be the same.
Noses are optional (e.g. :) and :-) are both valid).
