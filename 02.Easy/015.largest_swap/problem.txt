Write a function that takes a two-digit number and determines if it's the largest of
two possible digit swaps.

largest_swap(27) ➞ false

largest_swap(43) ➞ true

If 27 is our input, we should return false because swapping the digits gives us 72,
and 72 > 27. On the other hand, swapping 43 gives us 34, and 43 > 34.

Numbers with two identical digits (third example) should yield true (you can't do better).
