John is playing a dice game. The rules are as follows.

  -Roll two dice.
  -Add the numbers on the dice together.
  -Add the total to your overall score.
  -Repeat this for three rounds.

But if you roll DOUBLES, your score is instantly wiped to
0 and your game ends immediately!

Create a function which takes in a matrix as input,
and return John's score after his game has ended.
