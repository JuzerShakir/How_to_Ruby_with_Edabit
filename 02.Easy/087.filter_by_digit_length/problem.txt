Filter by Digit Length
Create a function that filters out an array to include numbers that only have a certain number of digits.

Examples
filter_digit_length([88, 232, 4, 9721, 555], 3) ➞ [232, 555]
# Include only numbers with 3 digits.

filter_digit_length([2, 7, 8, 9, 1012], 1) ➞ [2, 7, 8, 9]
# Include only numbers with 1 digit.

filter_digit_length([32, 88, 74, 91, 300, 4050], 1) ➞ []
# No numbers with only 1 digit exist => return empty array.

filter_digit_length([5, 6, 8, 9], 1) ➞ [5, 6, 8, 9]
# All numbers in the array have 1 digit only => return original array.
Notes
If no numbers of the specified digit length exist, return an empty array.
If all numbers in the array have the specified digit length, return the original array.
The sub-array returned should have the same relative order as the original array.
