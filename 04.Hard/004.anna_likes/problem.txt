Anna is a strange girl. She likes certain boys, but not others.
You have to figure out why she likes some, and not the others.
Examples
- anna_likes("David") ➞ false

- anna_likes("Samuel") ➞ true

- anna_likes("Gary") ➞ false

Notes:
    All names / inputs are valid.
    Anna likes her own name.
    Check the Tests tab for all 100 examples.
    Try to solve this one using RegEx. (check out main2.rb)
            (I have solved this using string methood)

 Check out the formula.txt file for similarities that I have explained between test that that give True and False. I have also given formula for it.
