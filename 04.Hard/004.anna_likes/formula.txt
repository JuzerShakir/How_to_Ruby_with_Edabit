The pattern is that first we need to see if the length of names are even, if not test will retrun False.
If length of names is even then it checks whether the number of vowels. Suppose the name length is 4 then it should have 2 vowels, if name length is 6 then it should have 3 vowels so on and so forth.

Formula  is :
    number of vowels in name * 2 == length of name
