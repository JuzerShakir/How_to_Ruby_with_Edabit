Get Students with Names and Notes Average
Create a function that takes an array of hashes like { name=> "John", notes=> [3, 5, 4]} and returns an array of hashes like { name=> "John", avgNote=> 4 }. If student has no notes (an empty array) then avgNote is zero.

Examples
[
  { name=> "John", notes=> [3, 5, 4]}
] âžž [
  { name=> "John", avgNote=> 4 }
]
Notes
Round the avgNote to a whole number.
