Hamming distance is the number of characters that differ between two strings.

To illustrate:
  String1: "abcbba"
  String2: "abcbda"

  Hamming Distance: 1 - "b" vs. "d" is the only difference.


Create a function that computes the hamming distance between two strings.

Examples:
  hamming_distance("abcde", "bcdef") ➞ 5

  hamming_distance("abcde", "abcde") ➞ 0

  hamming_distance("strong", "strung") ➞ 1


Notes:
Both strings will have the same length.
