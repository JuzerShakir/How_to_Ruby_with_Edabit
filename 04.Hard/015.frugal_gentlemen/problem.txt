The Frugal Gentleman
Atticus has been invited to a dinner party, and he decides to purchase a bottle of wine. However, he has little knowledge of how to choose a good bottle. Being a very frugal gentleman (yet disliking looking like a cheapskate), he decides to use a very simple rule. In any selection of two or more wines, he will always buy the second-cheapest.

Given an array of wine hashes, write a function that returns the name of the wine he will buy for the party. If given an empty array, return nil. If given an array of only one, Atticus will buy that wine.

Examples
chosen_wine([
  { "name": "Wine A", "price": 8.99 },
  { "name": "Wine 32", "price": 13.99 },
  { "name": "Wine 9", "price": 10.99 }
]) ➞ "Wine 9"

chosen_wine([{ "name": "Wine A", "price": 8.99 }]) ➞ "Wine A"

chosen_wine([]) ➞ nil
Notes
All wines will be different prices, so there is no confusion in the ordering.
