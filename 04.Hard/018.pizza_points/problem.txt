Pizza Points‚Ñ¢ üçï
Pizza Points

Google is launching a network of autonomous pizza delivery drones and wants you to create a flexible rewards system (Pizza Points‚Ñ¢) that can be tweaked in the future. The rules are simple: if a customer has made at least N orders of at least Y price, they get a FREE pizza!

Create a function that takes a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders and a minimum order price. Return a list of customers that are eligible for a free pizza.

Examples
customers = {
  "Batman": [22, 30, 11, 17, 15, 52, 27, 12],
  "Spider-Man": [5, 17, 30, 33, 40, 22, 26, 10, 11, 45]
}

  pizza_points(customers, 5, 20) ‚ûû ["Spider-Man"]

  pizza_points(customers, 3, 10) ‚ûû ["Batman", "Spider-Man"]

  pizza_points(customers, 5, 100) ‚ûû []
Notes
‚ö†Ô∏èSort the returned array of customer names in alphabetical order.
