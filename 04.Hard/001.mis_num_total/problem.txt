Create a function that returns the sum of missing numbers
from the given array.

missing_numbers([4, 3, 8, 1, 2]) ➞ 18
# 5 + 6 + 7 = 18

sum_missing_numbers([17, 16, 15, 10, 11, 12]) ➞ 27
# 13 + 14 = 27

sum_missing_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 0
# No Missing Numbers (i.e. all numbers in [1, 5] are present in
the list)

The numerical range to consider when searching for the missing
numbers in the array is the sequence of consecutive numbers
between the minimum and maximum of the numbers (inclusive).
