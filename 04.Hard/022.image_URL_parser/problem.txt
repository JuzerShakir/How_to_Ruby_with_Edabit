Imgur URL Parser
Create a function that takes an imgur link (as a string) and extracts the unique id and type. Return an object containing the unique id, and a string indicating what type of link it is.

The link could be pointing to:

An album (e.g. http://imgur.com/a/cjh4E)
A gallery (e.g. http://imgur.com/gallery/59npG)
An image (e.g. http://imgur.com/OzZUNMM)
An image (direct link) (e.g. http://i.imgur.com/altd8Ld.png)
Examples
imgur_url_parser("http://imgur.com/a/cjh4E") ➞ { id: "cjh4E", type: "album" }

imgur_url_parser("http://imgur.com/gallery/59npG") ➞ { id: "59npG", type: "gallery" }

imgur_url_parser("http://i.imgur.com/altd8Ld.png") ➞ { id: "altd8Ld", type: "image" }
Notes
There are a few cases where the link has some changes. Look at the additional tests in the Tests tab to know more.
