In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted
among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

    chickens = 2 legs
    cows = 4 legs
    pigs = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species.
You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals
