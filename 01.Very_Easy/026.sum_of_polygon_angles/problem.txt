Given an n-sided regular polygon n, return the total
sum of internal angles (in degrees).

  sum_polygon(3) ➞ 180

  sum_polygon(4) ➞ 360

  sum_polygon(6) ➞ 720

Notes:
  n will always be greater than 2.
  The formula (n - 2) x 180 gives the sum of all the
  measures of the angles of an n-sided polygon.
