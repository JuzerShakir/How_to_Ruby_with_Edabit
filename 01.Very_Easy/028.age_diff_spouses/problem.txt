Create a function that determines the age difference
between spouses in a household. The ages ages in years
of the parents and their children are given in an array.

If there is no difference in age between the parents,
return "No age difference between spouses.".
Otherwise, return the difference in years.
Check the examples for more clarification.

age_difference([29, 1, 6, 8, 28]) ➞ "1 year"

age_difference([43, 86, 49, 86]) ➞ "No age difference
                                    between spouses."

age_difference([2, 4, 6, 32, 27]) ➞ "5 years"


  - Note the singular "year".

  - The younger spouse (if the spouses are not the same age)
   will be older than their oldest child by a minimum of
   20 years.

  - The age difference between spouses will not be more
    than 18 years.
