Create a function that finds each number in the given array that is greater
than every number that comes after it. Your solution should return an array
of the number(s) that meet these criteria.

leader([2, 3, 20, 15, 8, 3]) ➞ [20, 15, 8, 3]
# Note that 20 is greater than all the elements to it's
# right side, similarly 15 and so on.

leader([8, 7, 1, 2, 10, 3, 5]) ➞ [10, 5]
# 10 is greater than all items to the right of it, so include.
# 3 is not greater than all items to the right of it, so exclude.
# 5 is greater than the remaining items, so include.
