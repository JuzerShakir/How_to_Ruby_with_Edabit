Create a function that accepts a string, checks if it's a valid email address and
returns either true or false, depending on the evaluation.

    The string must contain an @ character.
    The string must contain a . character.
    The @ must have at least one character in front of it.
        e.g. "e@edabit.com" is valid while "@edabit.com" is invalid.
    The . and the @ must be in the appropriate places.
        e.g. "hello.email@com" is invalid while "john.smith@email.com" is valid.

If the string passes these tests, it's considered a valid email address.
