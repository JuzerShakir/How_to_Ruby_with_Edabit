Book Shelf
Create a Book class that has two accessors :

title
author
and two additional methods:

A method named getTitle that returns: "Title: " + the instance title.
A method named getAuthor that returns: "Author: " + the instance author.
and instantiate this constructor by creating 3 new books:

Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen (pp)
Hamlet - William Shakespeare (h)
War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy (wp)
The name of the new hash instances pp, h, and wp, respectively.

For instance, if I instantiated the following book:

Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling (hp)
I would get the following properties and methods:

Examples
hp.title ➞ "Harry Potter"
hp.author ➞ "J.K. Rowling"
hp.get_title ➞ "Title: Harry Potter"
hp.get_author ➞ "Author: J.K. Rowling"
Notes

Remember, after you've finished writing the class, you must instantiate it through the creation of new instances.
