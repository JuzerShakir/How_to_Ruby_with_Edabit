Triple Letter Groupings
Given a string, return a sorted array of words formed from the first three letters, then the next three letters, shifting by only one.

Worked Example
three_letter_collection("edabit") ➞ ["abi", "bit", "dab", "eda"]
# 1st word: "eda"
# 2nd word: "dab"
# 3rd word: "abi"
# 4th word: "bit"
# Remember to sort the array!
Examples
three_letter_collection("slap") ➞ ["lap", "sla"]

three_letter_collection("cat") ➞ ["cat"]

three_letter_collection("hi") ➞ []
Notes
Return an empty array if given a word with less than 3 letters.
