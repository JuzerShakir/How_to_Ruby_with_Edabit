Get Student Top Notes
Create a function that takes an array of student hashes and returns an array of their top notes. If the student does not have notes then let's assume their top note is equal to 0.

Examples
get_student_top_notes([
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Jacek",
    notes: [5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 5]
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Ewa",
    notes: [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5]
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Zygmunt",
    notes: [2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3]
  }
]) âžž [5, 5, 4]
