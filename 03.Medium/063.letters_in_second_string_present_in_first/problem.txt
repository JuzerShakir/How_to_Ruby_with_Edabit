Are Letters in the Second String Present in the First?
Create a function that accepts an array of two strings and checks if the letters in the second string are present in the first string.

Examples
letter_check(["trances", "nectar"]) ➞ true

letter_check(["compadres", "DRAPES"]) ➞ true

letter_check(["parses", "parsecs"]) ➞ false
Notes
Function should not be case sensitive (as indicated in the second example).
Both strings are presented as a single argument in the form of an array.
Bonus: Solve this without RegEx.
