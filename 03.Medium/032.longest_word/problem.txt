Longest Word
Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. If two or more words are found, return the first longest word. Characters such as apostrophe, comma, period (and the like) count as part of the word (e.g. O'Connor is 8 characters long).

Examples
longest_word("Hello darkness my old friend.") ➞ "darkness"

longest_word("Hello there mate.") ➞ "Hello"

longest_word("Margaret's toy is plastic.") ➞ "Margaret's"
