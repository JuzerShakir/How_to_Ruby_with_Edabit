YouTube Upload Count
You are given an array of dates in the format Dec 11 and a month in the format Dec as arguments. Each date represents a video that was uploaded on that day. Return the number of uploads for a given month.

Examples
upload_count(["Sept 22", "Sept 21", "Oct 15"], "Sept") ➞ 2

upload_count(["Sept 22", "Sept 21", "Oct 15"], "Oct") ➞ 1
Notes
If you only pay attention to the month and ignore the day, the challenge will become easier.
