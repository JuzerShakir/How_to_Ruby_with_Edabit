Create a function where given the number n to count down from, and some words txt,
return a countdown sequence as a string leading up to the words at the end.

Put a full stop after each number and uppercase and add an exclamation mark to the word.
See the examples below for clarification!

  countdown(10, "Blast Off") ➞ "10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. BLAST OFF!"

  countdown(3, "go") ➞ "3. 2. 1. GO!"

  countdown(5, "FIRE") ➞ "5. 4. 3. 2. 1. FIRE!"
