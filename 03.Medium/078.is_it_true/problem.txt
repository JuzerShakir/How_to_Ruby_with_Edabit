Is it True?
In this challenge you will be given a relation between two numbers, written as a string. Write a function that determines if the relation is true or false.

Examples
is_it_true("2=2") ➞ true

is_it_true("8<7") ➞ false

is_it_true("5=13") ➞ false

is_it_true("15>4") ➞ true
Notes
Tests will only have three types of relations: =, >, and <
