Emphasise the Words
The challenge is to recreate the functionality of the titlecase() method into a function called emphasise(). The titlecase() method capitalises the first letter of every word and lowercases all of the other letters in the word.

Examples
emphasise("hello world") ➞ "Hello World"

emphasise("GOOD MORNING") ➞ "Good Morning"

emphasise("99 red balloons!") ➞ "99 Red Balloons!"
Notes
You won't run into any issues when dealing with numbers in strings.
