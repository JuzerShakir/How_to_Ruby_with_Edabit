Create a function which simplifies a given fraction into its simplest ratio.
Return the fraction as a string.

simplify_frac("2/4") ➞ "1/2"

simplify_frac("15/25") ➞ "3/5"

simplify_frac("4/9") ➞ "4/9"

Fractions are given as strings.
Return the same fraction if it is already in its simplified ratio (see example #3).
