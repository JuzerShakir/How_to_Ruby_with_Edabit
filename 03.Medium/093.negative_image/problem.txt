Negative Image
Suppose an image can be represented as a 2D array of 0s and 1s. Create a function to reverse an image. Replace the 0s with 1s and vice versa.

Examples
reverse_image([
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
]

reverse_image([
  [1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1]
]

reverse_image([
  [1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1]
]
