Odd Up, Even Down — N Times
Create a function that performs an even-odd transform to an array, n times. Each even-odd transformation:

Adds two (+2) to each odd integer.
Subtracts two (-2) from each even integer.
Examples
even_odd_transform([3, 4, 9], 3) ➞ [9, -2, 15]
# Since [3, 4, 9] => [5, 2, 11] => [7, 0, 13] => [9, -2, 15]

even_odd_transform([0, 0, 0], 10) ➞ [-20, -20, -20]

even_odd_transform([1, 2, 3], 1) ➞ [3, 0, 5]
